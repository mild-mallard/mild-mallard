- 👋 Hi, I’m @mild-mallard
- 👀 I’m interested in all things data, with a focus on using code to tell stories and conduct journalism
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, HTML/CSS/Javascript for data visualizations and some other odds and ends
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects related to journalism or data (though I still have lots to learn!)
